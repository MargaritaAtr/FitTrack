# Fit Track

Fit Track is my forth milestone project for Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

Fit Track is an e-commerce platform tailored for enthusiasts of Pilates and Running activities. Here, users can explore a diverse range of clothing, footwear, and accessories designed specifically for these pursuits. The platform offers intuitive navigation through various categories and employs sorting filters like name and category for seamless browsing. Additionally, users can employ keyword searches to swiftly locate desired items.

Functionality-wise, Fit Track provides essential features such as product purchasing, user account creation, login/logout mechanisms, and a convenient contact option for reaching out to the website owner with inquiries. Furthermore, users have the opportunity to leave reviews for purchased products, complete with a rating system ranging from 1 to 5. These reviews are made publicly available, contributing to the community's knowledge and aiding others in their purchasing decisions.

This thoughtful use of color ensures key elements catch the eye and engage users effectively.
