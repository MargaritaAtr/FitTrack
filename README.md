# Fit Track

Fit Track is my forth milestone project for Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

Fit Track is an e-commerce platform tailored for enthusiasts of Pilates and Running activities. Here, users can explore a diverse range of clothing, footwear, and accessories designed specifically for these pursuits. The platform offers intuitive navigation through various categories and employs sorting filters like name and category for seamless browsing. Additionally, users can employ keyword searches to swiftly locate desired items.

Functionality-wise, Fit Track provides essential features such as product purchasing, user account creation, login/logout mechanisms, and a convenient contact option for reaching out to the website owner with inquiries. Furthermore, users have the opportunity to leave reviews for purchased products, complete with a rating system ranging from 1 to 5. These reviews are made publicly available, contributing to the community's knowledge and aiding others in their purchasing decisions.

5. On Heroku add a config var named 'DATABASE_URL' and paste your ElephantSQL database URL as the accompanying value, then click 'Add'
6. Add all other necessary environment variables to this config var section from your project's .env file 
7. Find the 'Deploy' tab for your app on Heroku and click it
8. In the Deployment method section click 'Connect to GitHub', type your repo name, and click 'Connect'
9. Click 'Enable Automatic Deploys' to ensure that your GitHub repository and Heroku are synced if you make any further code or project changes
10. Click 'Deploy Branch' to let Heroku begin building the site

  #### Hooking Django up to S3

  1. Install boto3 and django-storages
      ```bash
      pip3 install boto3
      pip3 install django-storages
      pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
      ```

  2. Add the values from the `.csv` you downloaded to your Heroku Config Vars under Settings:
      ```bash
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      ```

  3. Delete the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable from your Config Vars and deploy your Heroku app, if you have enabled automatic deployment in Heroku this will happen automatically the next push you make to GitHub

  4. With your S3 bucket now set up, you can create a new folder called `media` (at the same level as the newly added `static` folder) and upload any required media files to it, making sure they are publicly accessible under **Permissions**


### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps.

1. Login to GitHub.
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen.
3. In the top right hand corner of the page locate and click the 'fork' button.
4. Near the bottom of the page click the green button that says 'Create Fork'.
5. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Login to GitHub.
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen.
3. Near the top of the repository click the green 'Code' button.
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under HTTPS copy the link provided.
5. Open the terminal in your code editor. 
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
8. Press Enter. Your local clone should be created.
9. To install all the required dependencies you just need to run the following...
    ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

* Note: this project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.*

- You will need to set your own environment variables for:

` DATABASE_URL
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  STRIPE_WH_SECRET`


If you use AWS to host your static/media files you will also need to set

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

Otherwise these must be adjusted as appropriate within settings.py


### Static and Media Files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

If you use gmail as your service provider for email then you will also need to set environment variables for:

    EMAIL_HOST_USER 
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD 
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
 
### Setting up Stripe Payments on your deployed site

1. Log in to Stripe, click on the developers tab and API keys copy the API key and set them in Heroku as config variables in the following:
   - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Stripe publishable key goes here
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe secret key goes here

2. Back in Stripe set up a new webhook for your deployed site by clicking on webhooks, click on 'add endpoint' and paste in your deployed site's URL setting it to listen for all events.

3. Click on your newly set up webhook and click on 'Signing Secret' at the top to reveal the secret value. Copy it and set it as a new config variable in Heroku:
   - `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`: Signing secret from new webhook.
